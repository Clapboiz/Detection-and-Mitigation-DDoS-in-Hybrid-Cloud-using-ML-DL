OS:

+ ParrotSec(effective and most reliable operating system)

Models used:

```
Naive bayes (strongest)
SVM
KNN
K-mean
```
### Data pre-processing
+ Normalization data(Basically normalization is a process of making data un-redundant able or removing all the redundancies and duplication from the data.)

+ Delete null data

Three values, ‘ tcp’, ‘udp’, or ‘icmp’. In this case, ‘tcp’ is represented as (1,0,0), ‘udp’ as (0,1,0), and ‘icmp’ as (0,0,1). After that, normalization is performed, which scales the feature values in the range [0,1].
